    Elden Ring has imperfect PC performance, but you can try a few things to smooth it out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these issues have workarounds; most don't. But here are some issues that Elden Ring is currently experiencing on PC, and whether you can do anything about them.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring frame rate stuttering</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The issue:</em> While playing Elden Ring on PC, no matter how powerful your system, the game will occasionally start chugging, dropping frames one moment, then compensating with wildly fast animations the next. This is obviously a death sentence in a game that demands split-second-precision. <br><br>
    <em>The fix:</em> This probably goes without saying, but you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version. If you have an Nvidia GPU, you can do this in the GeForce experience software; if you have an AMD GPU, you can do this in the Radeon software. I realize most players have probably already tried this, but it's worth double-checking - I had forgotten to do this before I started other troubleshooting methods, and it would have saved me a lot of time. <br><br>
    Otherwise, FromSoftware claims on Steam that it is “constantly working to improve the game so that it can be played comfortably on various PC environments and platforms.” In other words: Hang tight and wait for a patch. It's not an ideal solution, but it's the only one we've got.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring frame rate lock</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The issue:</em> Elden Ring is locked at 60 frames per second, which isn't ideal in a game that benefits from fast, fluid animations. It's especially frustrating if you're playing on a powerful system that could easily support higher frame rates. <br><br>
    <em>The fix:</em> Again, this is one of those “wait for a patch” issues - if FromSoftware decides to uncap the frame rate, which it may not do. In the meantime, there's a mod available to unlock the frame rate. We wouldn't necessarily recommend using it, however, as unauthorized mods and tightly regulated online play don't usually mix well together.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring invisible enemy glitch</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The issue:</em> While it's not as widespread as some of the other issues, some systems suffer from a glitch that turns all enemies in Elden Ring invisible as soon as you target-lock them. Even untargeting them doesn't restore their visibility. In a game that's as difficult as Elden Ring, this additional hurdle makes it nearly impossible to play. <br><br>
    <em>The fix:</em> From my own experience, I can say that updating my GPU drivers seemed to clear this up. If you're having similar problems and you're absolutely sure your GPU drivers are up to date, you might consider a clean driver install - or just hang tight for a patch.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring Easy Anti-Cheat issues</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The issue:</em> Elden Ring uses the Easy Anti-Cheat program to ensure that online play is fair for everyone. However, Easy Anti-Cheat sometimes refuses to launch, which means that the whole game refuses to launch alongside it. <br><br>
    <em>The fix:</em> Elden Ring's patch 1.02.1 seems to have fixed this issue. The fix went live on Feb. 26, so if you haven't downloaded it yet, get on Steam and do so. Your client should automatically download the patch before the game starts. <br><br>
    If that fails, I was able to work around this issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the game, although that's admittedly an extreme fix.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring mouse sensitivity</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The issue:</em> Elden Ring's mouse sensitivity is way higher than it should be, making it difficult to move the camera or navigate through menus. <br><br>
    <em>The fix:</em> If you insist on playing Elden Ring with a mouse and keyboard, you have a few options. The simplest is to wait for a patch, as FromSoftware is aware of this issue and currently working on it. If you have a gaming mouse, however, you can use your software (such as Razer Synapse or Logitech G Hub) to lower your mouse DPI and hopefully find a happy medium. <br><br>
    The other alternative would be to just use a gamepad, such as an Xbox or DualSense controller. It's an expensive option, but frankly, Elden Ring is a console game at heart. It's much easier to control with a gamepad than it is with a mouse and keyboard, even when everything is working properly.

    Here's how to fix some of the common Elden Ring performance and compatibility issues that you might run into. <br><br>
    Players are reporting troubles with gamepads, framerates, and Easy Anti-Cheat during their first day with Elden Ring. <br><br>
    Don't despair, Tarnished One. There are already fixes for some of the problems you might be seeing. Here are the most common Elden Ring launch issues we've seen so far and what you can do to fix them.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring framerate stuttering</h2>
  <p>
    Prior to launch, we encountered some pretty serious frame stuttering issues in Elden Ring. We observed frame rates dipping to half what we were normally playing at and down to 0 frames per second in the worst cases. The day one patch for Elden Ring fixed some of these issues, but frame drops are persisting even on systems that shouldn't be struggling to run the game. DirectX 12 shader compilation woes strike again. <br><br>
    <em>What to do:</em> There's no outright fix right now. Look at your Elden Ring main menu and be sure that you're on version 1.02 or later, and also ensure you're on the latest drivers for your graphics card. FromSoftware is working on additional patches to address this problem.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring controller not working</h2>
  <p>
    Lots of PC players have been reporting issues with Elden Ring not recognizing their gamepad, even when their PC does. We've had mixed results among PC Gamer staff members, but avoid alt+tabbing out of Elden Ring if possible, as that seems to have triggered our issues. <br><br>
    <em>What to do:</em> The solution that worked for us was to delete Vjoy, the virtual joystick program, from our Windows apps. Vjoy being installed seems like the common culprit. You can also try these other Elden Ring controller fixes, including checking your Steam gamepad settings to enable "Xbox Configuration Support" or "Generic Gamepad Configuration Support".
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring performance problems</h2>
  <p>
    Aside from framerate issues, players are experiencing other miscellaneous performance problems like crashing and screen tearing. Enough players are having issues that Elden Ring's launch day user reviews on Steam wound up "mixed." FromSoftware said it would be working on additional patches to address performance. <br><br>
    "We will be constantly working to improve the game so that it can be played comfortably on various PC environments and platforms. For the PC version, updating your graphics card drivers to the latest version may significantly improve performance." <br><br>
    <em>What to do:</em> While waiting for more official patches to roll out, make sure your graphics drivers are updated, as FromSoftware recommends.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring "Network status check failed"</h2>
  <p>
    If you see the "network status check failed" message, it means you've failed to connect to Elden Ring's online services. On launch weekend, it's possible you'll run into this problem as lots of folks rush in to play and the servers get crowded. The bad news is that there's nothing you've done wrong and no way to fix it on your end other than patience. The good news is that the player reports I've looked through so far have been from console players, not PC players. <br><br>
    <em>What do do:</em> FromSoftware said on February 27 that "the online issues Xbox users have been facing (e.g. 'Network Status Check Failed') should now be fixed." If you see this message in the future, the quick way to keep playing is to enable offline playing in your main menu.
  </p>
  <h2>Elden Ring Easy Anti-Cheat fails to launch</h2>
  <p>
    On PC, Elden Ring uses the Easy Anti-Cheat system to prevent cheating and hacking online. Unfortunately some players are getting griefed by Elden Ring itself before any rude invaders can show up in their games. If Elden Ring fails to launch while showing the EAC logo, this is likely the issue you're dealing with. <br><br>
    <em>What to do:</em> As of patch 1.02.1 on PC on February 26, FromSoftware says "start-up issues related to Easy Anti Cheat (EAC) have been improved". If you're still struggling to launch after updating your game version, our colleagues at Windows Central have outlined a way to disable EAC, which will mean you have to play offline but will be able to launch the game.
